  "description": "With the rise of DeFi apps, the need to get trusted price data has grown substantially. The only issue is that by default, a Tezos smart contract cannot receive any data from outside the blockchain. Oracles therefore offers to fetch data from off-chain sources and make it available on-chain. Oracles can aggregate data from multiple sources in order to guarantee the quality of the data. For instance, consider a decentralized application (Dapp) that needs the exchange rate of XTZ/BTC to perform some trading operation. To get that exchange rate, its smart contract needs to contact an oracle that can provide such information. The oracle can for example fetch the exchange rate from Binance and provide it as is to the smart contract. However, what happens if Binance gets hacked? The Dapp would then be compromised. An oracle can therefore fetch the price from multiple sources. e.g. Binance, CoinMarketCap, Dexter and Quipuswap, compute the average and exclude outliers (prices that too far from the others) that are likely from a compromised source. The chances that all 4 sources are compromised at the same time is very unlikely. The price provided to the Dapp is therefore very trustworthy and can be used for financially critical operations.",
