  "description": "With the rise of DeFi apps, the need to get trusted price data has grown substantially. The only issue is that by default, a Tezos smart contract cannot receive any data from outside the blockchain. Oracles therefore offers to fetch data from off-chain sources. Oracles can aggregate data from multiple sources in order to guarantee the quality of the data. For instance, consider a Dapp (decentralised app), that needs the exchange rate for XTZ/BTC. To get that exchange rate, the smart contract of the Dapp needs to contact an oracle that can provide this rate. The oracle can for example fetch the rate from Binance, but as a single point of failure, what happens if Binance gets hacked? The Dapp would then be compromised. The oracle can therefore fetch the price from multiple sources. e.g. Binance, CoinMarketCap, Dexter and Quipuswap, and exclude outliers (rates too far from the others) and compute an average. The chances that all 4 sources are compromised at the same time become very unlikely. The price provided to the Dapp is therefore very trustworthy and can be used for financially critical operations.",
