  "description": "In your life, you have probably had to borrow money, e.g., for a student loan, a car loan, or a mortgage. Lending and borrowing are essential services in any financial system. Traditionally, lenders such as banks, provide you with a loan in exchange for a fee in the form of an interest rate. Repaying the said loan is enforced by legal contracts with the bank.",
