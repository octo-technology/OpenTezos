This module will guide you through the complete installation and setup of your own Tezos node on Ubuntu and on Mac OS.

In this chapter, the reader will also grasp what a node is and how important it is in a Blockchain network.

## What is a node?
The node is the main actor of the Tezos blockchain and has two main functions: running the *gossip network* and updating the *context*.  
The *gossip network* is where all Tezos nodes exchange blocks and operations (see the *Admin Client* to monitor P2P connections). On this peer-to-peer network, an operation is spreading through the network and then baked into a block.  
The shell receives blocks from the gossip network and uses them to keep the current *context* up-to-date: *A full state of the blockchain* shared by all peers. Approximately every minute, a new block is created. When the shell receives it, it applies each operation to its *current context* and computes a *new context*.

The *last block* received on a chain, is also called the "*head*" of that chain. Each new head is then advertised by the node to its peers, disseminating this information to build a *consensus* across the network.

Other than passively observing the network, your node can inject its own new operations when instructed by the "`tezos-client`" application and even register as a delegate to bake new blocks with the "`tezos-baker-`" prefix. The node also has a view of the multiple chains that may exist concurrently and selects the best one based on its fitness (see [*Liquid Proof-of-Stake*](/tezos-basics/liquid-proof-of-stake) chapter in [*Tezos Basics*](/tezos-basics/introduction) module).
