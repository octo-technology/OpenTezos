title: How to use the tzStats blockchain explorer?
authors: Maxime Sallerin

In this chapter, we will use the [TzStats](https://tzstats.com/) explorer to illustrate the different features of an explorer, but similar features are usually available on others. Concerning the observation of smart contracts, the different aspects are discussed in the [following chapter](./tzstats-smart-contract).

[TzStats](https://tzstats.com/) is developed by _Blockwatch Data Inc._ It is a block explorer for public and private Tezos networks and, it is based on the [TzIndex indexer](https://github.com/blockwatch-cc/tzindex).

Each Tezos network has its own _TzStats_ version:

- **Mainnet**: [tzstats.com](https://tzstats.com)
- **Delphinet**: [delphi.tzstats.com](https://delphi.tzstats.com)
- **Edonet**: [edo.tzstats.com](https://edo.tzstats.com)
- **Florencenet**: [florence.tzstats.com](https://florence.tzstats.com)

## TzStats' main features

TzStats has a complete guide available [here](https://tzstats.com/docs/guide).

- [Main Dashboard](https://tzstats.com/): This page provides a quick view of all the main activity on the Tezos network, e.g. staking activity, gas price, Tez supply, transaction volume, etc.
