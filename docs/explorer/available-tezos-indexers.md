## Indexers potential features

- **Full-text search** in smart contract storage. For example, you can retrieve a smart contract by specifying a part of the Michelson code of the contract.
- **Michelson decoding**: The Michelson code is interpreted to be presented in a more readable way.
- **Bigmap support** Allows you to access and observe the content of Big Maps in the storage of smart contracts.
- **Mempool access**: some explorers provide access to the content of the mempool. The mempool is made of all transactions that have been submitted for inclusion in the chain but have not yet been included in a block by a baker.
- **Available Server APIs**
  - **Explorer API** for accessing individual objects of the explorer user interface via API calls.
  - **Time-series APIs** only contain numeric data types and are indexed by one date field. Through API calls, users can retrieve the entire time-series as well as a slice of it. It is great for aggregate counters and statistics over specific fields.
  - **Tables API** can include various unsorted data types (strings, numbers, dates, etc.) and can be filtered by different fields.
