The full source code of Tezos is available on [gitlab.com/tezos](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos). Tezos is written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), an _industrial-strength programming language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles_ [[1]](/contribute/tezos-core#references). OCaml is a functional programming language that offers speed, unambiguous syntax and semantics, and formal proofs of correctness.

The simplest way to contribute to Tezos is to [report an issue (as described in the previous chapter)](/contribute/report-issue). However, if you are proficient in OCaml, you can correct the error yourself or add new features and submit a merge request to the admins of the Tezos repository.

For more detailed information about how to proceed, please refer to the [official contribution guidelines here](tezos.gitlab.io/developer/contributing.html).
