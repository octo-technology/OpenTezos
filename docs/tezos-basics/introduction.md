## Tezos Creation
As early as 2014, Arthur Breitman had seen the weaknesses of the early blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, mainly:
* Their hard forks.
* The use of Proof of Work consensus, which is highly energy consuming and poses centralization problems due to the mining pools.
* The language of smart contracts which was prone to write insecure code.

His goal was to draw from the positive points of these blockchains, like the ability to run smart contracts, and propose solutions to overcome their existing weaknesses.
In August and September 2014, respectively,  Arthur Breitman and  Kathleen Breitman released the Tezos ‘[Position Paper](https://tezos.com/static/position_paper-841a0a56b573afb28da16f6650152fb4.pdf)’ and ‘[White Paper](https://tezos.com/static/white_paper-2dc8c02267a8fb86bd67a108199441bf.pdf)’ under the pseudonym L.M Goodman.

From March 2014 until July 2017, the company OCamlPro [[1]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/introduction#reference) took on the project of developing a Tezos prototype. The platform was thus developed in their preferred script, the OCaml language, a language mainly used in research.

## The Tezos ICO
On July 1st, 2017, Tezos launched its ICO (Initial Coin Offering) as a crowdsale. A crowdsale is similar to a crowdfunding process but the buyer invests in a future token. When the blockchain is launched and its tokens are created, the buyer receives his tokens according to the amount invested. When a new blockchain is created, an ICO is usually the way to go. The process allows for the dispatching of the future tokens between as many users as possible and involves them in the launching of the blockchain. This is especially important in the case of blockchains using Proof-of-stake consensus, as the more users hold a token the more secure the network is. The ICO, therefore, allows the network to be operational and robust from its start. The money collected from the selling of these tokens is also used to continue the development of the blockchain and in the case of Tezos to finance an ecosystem that will perpetuate its development and organization.

The Tezos ICO was a complete success: it stayed open for only 13 days but managed to collect 66,000 Bitcoins and 361,000 Ethers. At the time, this represented 232 million dollars collected but nowadays with the success and growing market price of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tezos, the value is now much higher.

In order to manage the growth of the currency, the Tezos founders created the Tezos foundation based in Switzerland, with a role to help the network evolve and grow. The foundation has no control over the blockchain’s governance model and it is not entitled to manage the Tezos network. But has since the ICO gradually traded its Bitcoin and Ether for Swiss Franc to finance beneficial projects for the blockchain [[2]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/introduction#reference).

## The Tezos key points
Compared to previous generations of blockchains (Bitcoin and Ethereum), the Tezos blockchain is distinguished by 3 main characteristics:

* The governance allows for the self-evolution of the protocol.
* The use of LPOS (Liquid-Proof-of-Stake) consensus.
* The development of smart contracts using the Michelson language allowing the use of formal verification methods.

This module explains how the Tezos consensus algorithm works and provides a first interaction with this blockchain.
