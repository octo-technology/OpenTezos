## Tezos Creation
As early as 2014, _Arthur Breitman_ had seen the weaknesses of the early blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, mainly:
* their hard forks,
* the use of the _Proof-of-Work_ consensus, which is highly energy consuming and poses centralization problems due to the mining pools,
* and finally the language of smart contracts which was prone to writing insecure code.

His goal was to keep the good from these early blockchains (e.g. the ability to run smart contracts), but overcome their existing weaknesses.

In August and September 2014, Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman respectively released the Tezos [Position Paper](https://tezos.com/static/position_paper-841a0a56b573afb28da16f6650152fb4.pdf) and [White Paper](https://tezos.com/static/white_paper-2dc8c02267a8fb86bd67a108199441bf.pdf) under the pseudonym L.M Goodman.

From March 2014 until July 2017, the company OCamlPro [[1]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/introduction#references) took on the project of developing a Tezos prototype. The platform was thus developed in their preferred script, the OCaml language, a language mainly used in research.

## The Tezos ICO
On July 1st, 2017, Tezos launched its ICO (Initial Coin Offering) as a crowdsale. A crowdsale is similar to a crowdfunding process but the buyer invests in a future token. When the blockchain is launched and its tokens are created, the buyer receives his tokens according to the amount invested. When a new blockchain is created, an ICO is usually the way to go. The process allows for the dispatch of the future tokens between as many users as possible and involves them in the launch of the blockchain. This is especially important in the case of blockchains using the _Proof-of-Stake_ consensus, as the more users hold a token the more secure the network is. The ICO thus allows the network to be operational and robust from its start. The money collected from the sell of these tokens is also used to continue the development of the blockchain, and in the case of Tezos, to finance an ecosystem that will perpetuate its development and organization.

The Tezos ICO was a complete success: it stayed open for only 13 days but managed to collect 66,000 Bitcoins and 361,000 Ethers. At the time, this represented 232 million dollars, but with the success and growing market price of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tezos, this value is now much higher.

In order to manage the growth of the currency, the Tezos founders created the `Tezos Foundation` based in Switzerland, with the role to help the network evolve and grow. The foundation has no control over the blockchain’s governance model and it is not entitled to manage the Tezos network. Since the ICO, he has however been gradually trading its Bitcoins and Ethers for Swiss Francs in order to finance beneficial projects for the blockchain though grants to the community [[2]](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/introduction#references).

## The Tezos key points
Compared to previous generations of blockchains (mainly Bitcoin and Ethereum), the Tezos blockchain is distinguished by 3 main characteristics:

* The governance allows for the self-evolution of its protocol.
* The consensus in use is the LPOS (Liquid-Proof-of-Stake) which allows for much better energy consumption and better decentralization.
* The development of smart contracts is done in the Michelson language which allows for formal verification methods.

This module will now show you the basics of Tezos, from how its consensus algorithm works to how make your first interactions with the blockchain.
