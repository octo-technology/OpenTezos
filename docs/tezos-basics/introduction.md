## Tezos Creation
Since 2014, Arthur Breitman has seen the weaknesses of early blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, mainly:
* Hard forks.
* The Proof of Work consensus which is energy consuming and poses centralization problems because of the mining pools.
* The language of smart contracts which can make us write insecure code.

His goal was then to take only the positive points of these blockchains like smart contracts and to propose solutions to overcome these weaknesses.
In August and September 2014, respectively,  Arthur Breitman and  Kathleen Breitman released the Tezos ‘[Position Paper](https://tezos.com/static/position_paper-841a0a56b573afb28da16f6650152fb4.pdf)’ and ‘[White Paper](https://tezos.com/static/white_paper-2dc8c02267a8fb86bd67a108199441bf.pdf)’ with the pseudonym L.M Goodman.

From March 2014 until July 2017, the company OCamlPro [1](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/introduction#reference) was involved in the development of the Tezos prototype. The platform was thus developed in the OCaml language mainly used in the research.

## The Tezos ICO
On July 1st, 2017, Tezos launched an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) as a crowdsale. A crowdsale is similar to a crowdfunding process but the buyer invests in a future token. When the blockchain and its token are created, the buyer receives his tokens according to the amount invested. When the new blockchain is created, an ICO is usually the way to go. This process allows to dispatch future tokens between many users and to involve them in the making of the blockchain. This is especially important in the case of a Proof-of-stake blockchain as the more users hold tokens the more secure the network is. The ICO therefore allows for the network to be operational and robust at its start. The money collected is also used to continue its development and in the case of Tezos to finance an ecosystem that will perpetuate his development and organization.

The Tezos ICO was a complete success : it stayed open for only 13 days but managed to collect 66,000 Bitcoins and 361,000 Ethers. In 2017, it represented 232 million dollars but nowadays with the success of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tezos, this value is now much higher.

In order to manage this currency, the Tezos founders created the Tezos foundation based in Switzerland. The foundation's role is to help the network evolve but not  to replace the blockchain’s governance model. The foundation is not entitled to interact nor manage the Tezos network. Since the ICO, the foundation has gradually traded its Bitcoin and Ether for Swiss Franc to finance projects [2](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/introduction#reference).

## The Tezos key points
Compared to previous generations of blockchains (Bitcoin and Ethereum), the Tezos blockchain is distinguished by 3 main characteristics:

* The governance allows the self-evolution of the protocol.
* The LPOS (Liquid-Proof-of-Stake) consensus.
* The development of smart contracts with the Michelson language allows the use of formal verification methods.

This module explains how the Tezos consensus algorithm works and provides a first overview of the possible interaction with this blockchain.
