This section describes how to bridge the Tezos world (and the Michelson language) with the formal world of _Coq_. For this, we are going to model a theorem representing a smart contract and its purpose (i.e. the goal of the smart contract).

This chapter is based on the _Vote_ smart contract seen in [previous modules](/ligo).

## Overview
The Tezos blockchain can run smart contracts using the Michelson language. Michelson is a low-level stack-based Turing-complete language that is formally proven. The proof of Michelson language is compiled in a library called **Mi-Cho-Coq** (check the official documentation [[2]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references)). 

_Mi-Cho-Coq_ is based on the _Curry-Howard isomorphism_ ([[5] [6] [7]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references)), which ensures the correspondence between a program and a theorem. _Mi-Cho-Coq_ is used in the _coq_ proof assistant to translate a Michelson script into a theorem (i.e., into its logical equivalent form). The official documentation of _Coq_ can be found here [[1]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references), but we recommend easier-to-read documentation such as this introduction to _Coq_ [[3]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references).

> The Coq proof assistant is built upon the paradigm of **calculus of constructions** (as described by Thierry Coquand [[16]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references)). The _Gallina_ language [[4]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references) (the language allowing to interact with the Coq engine) provides a syntax (Terms) for describing formal objects (like a theorem) and also provides a set of instructions (Vernacular syntax) called _tactics_ for writing the proof of the theorem.

The formal verification of a Michelson smart contract is done by providing the proof for this theorem. *Coq* will perform the verification of a given proof (and its related theorem) based on the *Mi-Cho-Coq* proof.

The proof consists in a sequence of _tactics_ which the Coq engine will interpret. These instructions manipulate formal expressions (following logical laws (_Coq_ universe) and _Mi-Cho-Coq_ definitions) to formally assert the truth of a given theorem (based on given assumptions).

Before going deeper, let's illustrate the workflow of formal verification of Tezos smart contracts in Fig. 1 below.

![](../../static/img/formal-verification/overview_process.svg)
<small className="figure">FIGURE 1: Proof process</small>

Notice that the _Coq_ language (called **Gallina** [[4]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references)) provides 2 parts:
- **Terms** is the specification language: for modeling logical objects (such as theorems, axioms, assumptions, logical rules, specifications)
- **Vernacular** is the language of commands: for writing a proof of a theorem (_tactics_ are provided to interactively prove a theorem).


## Modeling a smart contract as a theorem
This ecosystem combines an assistant of proof (*Coq*) and the proof of the Michelson language (*Mi-Cho-Coq*) to formally verify the correctness of a theorem and its proof.

The theorem is based on 
- a Michelson script representing what the smart contract does.
- post-conditions representing the rules of the smart contract in a formal form.

Formal verification of a Tezos smart contract consists in verifying formally that **the execution of the Michelson script satisfies specific post-conditions**.

![](../../static/img/formal-verification/overview_theorem.svg)
<small className="figure">FIGURE 2: Naive description of the theorem</small>

This schema describes an equivalence between the execution of instructions and post-conditions (A, B, C, D). Post-conditions are rules that must be verified, but these post-conditions do not describe the whole behavior of the smart contract, only specific traits representing the intent of the smart contract.

In the following sections, we will detail how the execution of a Michelson script can be formally written and how to define post-conditions. We will then study the formal proof as a sequence of _Coq_ tactics (cf. the _Vernacular_ part of the _Gallina_ language).

### Smart contract invocation
Tezos smart contract can be written in high-level languages (such as LIGO, SmartPy and others) but are ultimately compiled in Michelson.

A smart contract invocation requires the smart contract itself (through its address), the entrypoint that is being called (and its related arguments) and the storage state.

If all these elements are provided, the execution of the smart contract code is triggered, which will result in side-effects on the storage and optionally on the Tezos network.

![](../../static/img/formal-verification/smartcontract_invocation.svg)
<small className="figure">FIGURE 3: Execution of an entrypoint of a smart contract triggering its code and thus side-effect on storage and Tezos network.</small>

The entrypoint information is used to identify which portion of the code will be executed.
The entrypoint arguments and the storage are used as the context of execution (i.e, the execution stack is initialized with arguments and a storage). 
The execution of the code produces a new storage state and operations.
The operations produced by this invocation are some new invocations of other smart contracts.

### Formally modeling the execution of a Tezos smart contract
Now let's see how to formulate formally **the execution of the Michelson script**. 

As we have seen, the **the execution of the Michelson script** produces a new storage state (we consider there are no operations produced). 

So, formally speaking:

```
EXECUTION(CODE,arguments,storage) produces a new storage 
```

The execution of code is done by evaluating a sequence of Michelson instruction for a given initial stack (an `eval` function is provided by _Coq_). The execution of code also requires a context and a quantity of gas to be able to execute each instruction (requirement defined by _Mi-Cho-Coq_). So the execution of code can be formalized as:

```
eval env CODE fuel (arguments,storage) = return (newstorage)
```

where:
- `fuel` represents the quantity of gas.
- `env` represents a context of evaluation for the Coq engine.
- `eval` represents an evaluator which effectively executes each instruction sequentially on the provided initial stack.
- `arguments` represents the parameter (entrypoint) and its related arguments.
- `storage` represents the storage state before the execution.
- `newstorage` represents the resulting storage after the execution.

The theorem can be formalized as:

```
eval env CODE fuel (arguments, storage) = return (newstorage) <=> post-conditions
```
where `<=>` represents an equivalence

Now let's see how to define post-conditions.

### Post-conditions
Post-conditions are logical assertions that model the intention of the smart contract. In other words, post-conditions are logical expressions defining constraints to verify on storage data.

The work is to identify rules (or constraints) that ensure the correctness of the execution (i.e., ensure that the storage cannot end up in an invalid state).

In fact, post-conditions are usually multiple assertions combined with a logical _AND_ operator ( `^` in _Coq_).

```
post-conditions <=> A ^ B ^ C ^ D
```

Since post-conditions are a generic concept formalizing the smart contract intention as logical assertions, we will use an example in order to illustrate the modeling ofpost-conditions.

### Example Vote
Let's consider a very simple _Vote_ smart contract that handles a voting process. The complete implementation of the theorem and its proof are available at [[20]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references). In this section, we explain the "Vote" reference example. The _Vote_ smart contract allows anyone to vote for a candidate (we consider that candidates are registered and their number of votes is initialized to zero).

When someone invokes the _Vote_ smart contract, one must indicate the candidate. If the candidate is registered then its corresponding number of votes is incremented.

> When someone invokes the _Vote_ smart contract it will only modify its storage and thus will have no impact on other smart contract storages. (i.e. the execution of the smart contract will not produce `operations`). 



Here is the code of the smart contract:

```
{
    parameter (string %vote);
    storage (map string int);
    code {
        AMOUNT;
        PUSH mutez 5000000;
        COMPARE; GT;
        IF { FAIL } { NOOP };
        DUP; DIP { CDR; DUP }; CAR; DUP;
        DIP {
            GET; ASSERT_SOME;
            PUSH int 1; ADD; SOME
        };
        UPDATE;
        NIL operation; PAIR
    }
}
```

Notice that candidates are identified by a `string` value (entrypoint argument) and the storage is a `map string int`.

Notice that amount of Tez transferred must be lower than five million; otherwise the execution fails.

Notice also that the candidate must be registered; otherwise the execution fails.

This very simple script is equivalent to this pseudo-code:

```
candidate is string
storageMap is map(key=string, value=int)

....
function code(amount, candidate, storageMap) : storageMap {
    if (amount > 5000000)
        fail()
    else if (candidate not in storageMap)
        fail()
    else 
        storageMap[candidate] += 1;
    return storageMap;
}
```

`amount` and `candidate` are given as arguments.

#### Parameter definition
The parameter type and storage type can be defined in _Coq_ as two distinct definitions:

```
Definition parameter_ty : type := string.
Definition storage_ty := map string int.
```

The parameter type (`parameter_ty`) can be wrap into a `SelfType` definition as follow:

```
Module ST : (SelfType with Definition self_type := parameter_ty).
  Definition self_type := parameter_ty.
End ST.
```

It will be used when defining the smart contract.


#### Annotated script
The Tezos smart contract is a Michelson script but it cannot be taken as input by the Coq engine as it is.

Mi-Cho-Coq (which is the Coq specification of the Michelson language) provides the correspondence between a Michelson instruction and an equivalent logical proposition.

There is no automated process that translates a Michelson code into a formal definition based on Mi-Cho-Coq definitions. This must be done manually.


The _Vote_ smart contract can be formalized in a formal definition in Coq (_Terms_ part of the _Gallina_ language).

```
Definition vote : full_contract _ ST.self_type storage_ty :=
(
    AMOUNT ;;
    PUSH mutez (5000000 ~mutez);;
    COMPARE;; GT;;
    IF ( FAIL ) ( NOOP );;
    DUP;; DIP1 ( CDR;; DUP );; CAR;; DUP;;
    DIP1 (
      GET (i := get_map string int);; ASSERT_SOME;;
      PUSH int (Int_constant 1%Z);; ADD (s := add_int_int);; SOME
    );;
    UPDATE (i := Mk_update string (option int) (map string int) (Update_variant_map string int));;
    NIL operation;; PAIR 
).
```

This `vote` definition will be used to formalize the theorem. Notice that it takes the parameter and storage types (`parameter_ty`, `storage_ty`) as arguments.

Notice that `GET`, `UPDATE`, `ADD` and `PUSH` instructions are annotated:
- `ADD (s := add_int_int)` indicates it is an addition between two integers.
- `GET (i := get_map string int)` indicates it accesses elements into a `map string int`. 
- `UPDATE (i := Mk_update string (option int) (map string int) (Update_variant_map string int))` indicates it updates (`Mk_update`) a `map` with a `string` as key and an `option int` as value.

#### Post-conditions
As said previously, post-conditions are logical expressions defining constraints to verify on the storage data.

In our example _Vote_ smart contract, the storage is a map containing the number of votes per candidate.

Let's see how we can define logical assertions on the storage data.

First, let's define some rules governing the voting process:
- "When someone votes for a candidate, its number of votes increments by 1".
- "When someone votes for a candidate, the number of votes of other candidates does not change".
- "When someone votes for a candidate, it does not change the list of candidates".
- "If the voting process is successful, then it means that the candidate is registered".
- "Invoking this smart contract does not impact the rest of the Tezos network, only the related storage".

Now, these rules can be translated into formal propositions. These propositions depend on the given parameter, the current storage state and the new storage state (and the produced operations).

![](../../static/img/formal-verification/postconditions_rules.svg)
<small className="figure">FIGURE 4: Post conditions of _Vote_ smart contract.</small>

The rule "Keys of the old storage exists in the new storage" can be written in Coq (Gallina - Terms) with the following:

```
(forall s, (mem _ _ (Mem_variant_map _ int) s storage) <->
        (mem _ _ (Mem_variant_map _ int) s new_storage))
```

This expression verifies that all keys of the old storage are defined in the new storage.

The rule "For Bob, number of votes is incremented" can be formulated as: "For each element of the mapping whose key is equal to the given parameter, the new value must be equal to the old value plus one". It can be written in Coq (Gallina - Terms) with the following:

```
match (get _ _ _ (Get_variant_map _ int) param storage) with
  | Some n1 => match (get _ _ _ (Get_variant_map _ int) param new_storage) with
              | Some n2 => n2 = (BinInt.Z.add n1 1)
              | None => False
              end
  | None => False end
```

The rule "For others, number of votes do not change" can be formulated as: "For each element of the mapping different from the given parameter, ensure that the old value is equal to the new value". It can be written in Coq (Gallina - Terms) with the following:

```
(forall s, s <> param ->
   match (get _ _ _ (Get_variant_map _ int) s storage) with
  | Some n1 => match (get _ _ _ (Get_variant_map _ int) s new_storage) with
              | Some n2 => n2 = n1
              | None => False
              end
  | None => True end)
```

The rule "Only the storage is modified" can be expressed by verifying that no operations have been produced. It can be written in Coq (Gallina - Terms) with the following:

```
returned_operations = nil
```

As seen previously, the smart contract can be executed only if the amount of Tez transferred is lower than 5000000; otherwise the execution fails. This constraint can be written in Coq (Gallina - Terms) with the following:

```
(Z.ge (tez.to_Z (amount env)) 5000000)
```

To sum up, our post-conditions are a combination of all these logical rules merged into a single object which depends on the given old storage state and parameter, and the resulting new storage state (and the returned operations).

This object `vote_spec` represents the post-conditions of the voting process: 

```
Definition vote_spec
           (storage: data storage_ty)
           (param : data parameter_ty)
           (new_storage : data storage_ty)
           (returned_operations : data (list operation)) :=
  (* Preconditions *)
  (Z.ge (tez.to_Z (amount env)) 5000000) /\
  mem _ _ (Mem_variant_map _ int) param storage /\
  (* Postconditions *)
  (forall s, (mem _ _ (Mem_variant_map _ int) s storage) <->
        (mem _ _ (Mem_variant_map _ int) s new_storage)) /\
  returned_operations = nil /\
  match (get _ _ _ (Get_variant_map _ int) param storage) with
  | Some n1 => match (get _ _ _ (Get_variant_map _ int) param new_storage) with
              | Some n2 => n2 = (BinInt.Z.add n1 1)
              | None => False
              end
  | None => False end /\
  (forall s, s <> param ->
   match (get _ _ _ (Get_variant_map _ int) s storage) with
  | Some n1 => match (get _ _ _ (Get_variant_map _ int) s new_storage) with
              | Some n2 => n2 = n1
              | None => False
              end
  | None => True end).
  
```

Notice that the `vote_spec` definition above express logical assertions depending on:
- the initial storage state (`storage`)
- the returned storage state (`new_storage`)
- the parameter (`param`)
- the returned operations (`returned_operations`)

To conclude, the _Vote_ smart contract is defined by the `vote_spec` definition and can be used to formalize the theorem.


#### Theorem definition
As said previously, the formal verification of a Tezos smart contract consists in verifying formally that **the execution of the Michelson script satisfies specific post-conditions**.

Also, as said previously, the theorem can be formalized as:

```
eval env CODE fuel (arguments, storage) = return (newstorage) <=> post-conditions
```

Here is a schema describing graphically the theorem formalization:

![](../../static/img/formal-verification/theorem_graphical.svg)
<small className="figure">FIGURE 5: Description of the theorem.</small>

Now that we have defined the post-conditions to verify, we can define the theorem in Gallina (Terms) syntax.

```
Theorem vote_correct
      (storage : data storage_ty)
      (param : data parameter_ty)
      (new_storage : data storage_ty)
      (returned_operations : data (list operation))
      (fuel : Datatypes.nat) :
  fuel >= 42 ->
  eval env vote fuel ((param, storage), tt) = Return ((returned_operations, new_storage), tt)
  <-> vote_spec storage param new_storage returned_operations.
```

Notice that the `vote` object represents our smart contract (in a formal representation).

Notice also that the `vote_spec` object represents the post-conditions to verify (in a formal representation).

We can represent this equivalence between the execution of the code and the verification of post-conditions by the following diagram.

![](../../static/img/formal-verification/theorem_graphical_detail.svg)
<small className="figure">FIGURE 6: Detailed description of the theorem.</small>

Notice that the `vote_spec` definition is used as post condition and requires 4 arguments (`storage`, `param`, `new_storage`, `returned_operations`). 

## Proof
Now that the intention of our smart contract has been modeled into post-conditions and that our smart contract has been translated into a theorem (which combines evaluation of a sequence of Michelson instruction and those logical post-conditions), we need to prove that this theorem is true.

The demonstration or proof of the theorem can be expressed with a sequence of _Coq_ tactics.

Since the theorem is a complex logical proposition, it is suggested to decompose it into simpler propositions easily provable. This decomposition is done by separating into smaller independent propositions or applying reductions (see reductions in Gallina [[4]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references)).

The following proof script relies on:
- tactics (commands of the Vernacular of Gallina) 
- induced types (Mi-Cho-Coq)
- proven theorem of Mi-Cho-Coq dealing with Tezos smart contract properties (e.g. gas)
- the _Coq_ universe, which defines sets of numbers and related theorem. For example, natural integers are defined upon the _Peano_ arithmetic.

Here is the proof of the Vote smart contract.

This chapter is not intended to be a _Coq_ tutorial, we will not deep further into this script.  

## Conclusion

In this section, we provided explanations of the _Vote_ example to illustrate: 
- how to translate a Tezos smart contract into a formal definition based on Mi-Cho-Coq definitions
- how to design post-conditions modeling the intention of a smart contract (with the _Vote_ smart contract example)
- how to define a theorem based on the Mi-Cho-coq evaluator and post-conditions.
- a proof (the proof of the _Vote_ theorem).

To learn more about proof implementation in _Coq_, we recommend these simple tutorials [[3]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references), [[14]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references) as a start and the Coq'Art book [[15]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references) for a more complete overview. 

We also recommend to check other examples provided with the Mi-Cho-Coq repository [[21]](/formal-verification/modeling-theorem#references).
