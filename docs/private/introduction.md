Tezos is a public blockchain network that includes innovative features such as on-chain governance and proof of stake. Smart contracts on Tezos are compiled to Michelson, a stack-based, functional language that lends itself to formal verification.

A private chain of Tezos provides a controlled environment for development, testing, or consortium-governed networks popular in enterprise settings.

This module will use the scripts available on the [Github Serokell](https://github.com/serokell/private-tezos-blockchain) for the configuration and deployment of a private Tezos blockchain on a Testnet network.

To run a private blockchain using those scripts, you should do the following:

1. Set up your workspace environment
2. Generate genesis block and bootstrap bakers
3. Start and use the Blockchain

You can also add a VPN Configuration
