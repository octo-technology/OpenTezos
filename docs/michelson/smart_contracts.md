## Entry points, storage and code

Michelson is a domain-specific language and is designed for implementing smart contracts. Tezos smart contracts contain three main pieces of information:
- the type definition of the **parameter** when invoking the smart contract (often called **entry point**)
- the type definition of the persistent data structure associated with the smart contract (referred to as **storage**)
- a sequence of instructions to be executed when invoking the smart contract (this is the **code** of the smart contract)

Basically, an empty smart contract defines those three pieces of information (parameter, storage, code) and looks like this:

```js
parameter unit;
storage unit;
code { CDR ;
       NIL operation ;
       PAIR };
```

The example below shows a simple smart contract implementing a counter: 

```js
{ parameter (or (or (nat %add) (nat %sub)) (unit %default)) ;
  storage int ;
  code { AMOUNT ; PUSH mutez 0 ; ASSERT_CMPEQ ; UNPAIR ;
         IF_LEFT
           { IF_LEFT { ADD } { SWAP ; SUB } }
           { DROP ; DROP ; PUSH int 0 } ;
         NIL operation ; PAIR } }
```

Notice that the type definition of the storage is `int`.

The three possible entry points (add, sub, and default) are specified in a single logical structure composed of logical _or_ operators. Since _or_ is a two-operand operator, we need a nested _or_ structure to represent 3 or more elements.

```js
(or (or (nat %add) (nat %sub)) (unit %default))
```

We will delve into this more deeply in the code portion of the "union" section.

## Address and balance

Tezos smart contracts also have built-in internal information such as an address (where the smart contract is deployed) and a balance that is associated with this address (once deployed).

The balance represents the quantity of XTZ associated with a smart contract. The smallest divisible part is a mutez (1 tez = 1,000,000 mutez).


## Stack-based language

Generally a _stack_ data structure is a linear collection of elements where elements can be added or removed with `PUSH` and `POP` instructions. In the Michelson language, elements can be pushed to the top of the pile or removed from the top of the pile. This kind of stack is called LIFO (Last In First Out).

The _Instructions_ section describes basic stack manipulations allowed by the Michelson language.

## Invocation and transaction return (list of operations, storage)

The invocation of a smart contract is an explicit call for executing the code of the smart contract. It requires a call parameter which is a tuple of two elements (`PAIR`) containing:
- a value of the entry point
- the value of the storage (current storage state)

The invocation of the smart contract is expected to produce a tuple of two elements (`PAIR`) containing:
- a list of operations (which are new transactions generated by this invocation).
- the new storage state.

This list of operations represents all impacts your contract will have on the rest of the Tezos blockchain.
The new storage state represents the impact your invocation will have on the contract storage.

The diagram below describes the execution of the "empty smart contract" (seen in the previous section). Although this contract does not modify anything, it still has to fulfill the mentioned expectations (input and output format).

Notice that this script performs no modifications. Storage is given as a parameter and returned.


Now, let's dive deep into the Michelson language.
