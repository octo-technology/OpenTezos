## Function

The example below comes from [Tezos Academy](https://tezosacademy.io/pascal/chapter-functions) and represents a modification of the id of a `spaceship`.

So the following function takes a string `my_ship` as input, modifies the third character to 1 and assigns the result to a constant `modified_ship`.

```js
type ship_code is string
var my_ship : ship_code := "020433"
function modify_ship_code (const my_ship : ship_code) : ship_code is
  block {
    const modified_ship = String.sub(0n, 2n, my_ship) ^ "1" ^ String.sub(3n, 3n, my_ship)
  } with modified_ship
```

You can call the function `modify_ship_code` defined above by using the LIGO dev tools:

```shell
ligo run-function function_example.ligo modify_ship_code '020433'
# Outputs: '021433'
```

## Record

The structured type `record` is here, used to define the coordinates of a planet in the solar system.

```js
type coordinates is
    record [
        x : int;
        y : int;
        z : int
    ]

var earth_coordinates : coordinates :=
    record [
        x = 2;
        y = 7;
        z = 1
    ]

patch earth_coordinates with record [z = 5]
```

>A `patch with` instruction takes a `record` data structure to be updated and a subset of the fields to update, then modifies the recorded data structure in accordance to the new specified subset of fields.


## Main function

In LIGO, the design aims to have one main function called `main`, which dispatches the control flow according to its parameter. The functions used for those actions are called entrypoints.

In the example below:
- The functions `set_ship_code` and `go_to` are the entrypoints.
- `Set_ship_code` and `Go_to` are the associated actions.

```js
type parameter is
  Set_ship_code of string
| Go_to of string

type storage is record [
  ship_code : string;
  destination : string
]

type return is list (operation) * storage

function set_ship_code (const input_string : string; const store : storage) : return is
  ((nil : list (operation)), store with record [ship_code = input_string])

function go_to (const input_string : string; const store : storage) : return is
  ((nil : list (operation)), store with record [destination = input_string])

function main (const action : parameter; const store : storage): return is
  case action of
    Set_ship_code (input_string) -> set_ship_code (input_string, store)
  | Go_to (input_string) -> go_to (input_string, store)
  end
```

## Option

The example below comes from [Tezos Academy](https://tezosacademy.io/pascal/chapter-option) and deals with the modification of the weapon power of a spaceship to illustrate the use of option types.

In the code below, we can see that the _weapons_ variable are defined as a mapping between the name of each weapon and its corresponding input of power. Here, we want to increase the power of the _Main Laser_ but the mapping returns an _optional_ result as it might not be found in the mapping. We define the constant `main_laser_power` as an optional `int` by selecting _Main Laser_ from the weapons mapping.

We write a pattern matching the `main_laser_power`:
- If it exists, it increases the power of the _Main Laser_ by 1 (use `i` as a temporary matching variable).  
- If it does not exist in the mapping, it will fail with `Weapon not found`.

```js
type weapon_power is map (string, int)

function main (const p : unit; const store : unit) : (list(operation) * unit) is
  block {
    const weapons : weapon_power =
        map [
            "Main Laser" -> 5;
            "Right Laser" -> 2;
            "Left Laser" -> 3;
        ];

    const main_laser_power : option(int) = weapons["Main Laser"];
    case main_laser_power of
      Some(i) -> weapons["Main Laser"] := i + 1
    | None -> failwith("Weapon not found")
    end

  } with ((nil: list(operation)), unit)
```

# Full example - FundAdvisor

This example illustrates the communication between contracts (with get_entrypoint_opt LIGO function) and lambda patterns allowing you to modify a contract that is already deployed. The example showd implementing, deploying and interacting with Tezos smart contracts.

## The Fund and its advisor

The `indice` contract represents a _fund_ value, and the `advisor` contract gives an advice on investing in this fund.

### Transaction workflow

The `advisor` contract can be invoked to request the fund value to the `indice` contract (via a transaction). The `indice` contract receives the request (transaction)cand will send back the requested value. When the `advisor` contract receives the fund value, it can apply the _algorithm_ to check if it is worth investing!

<br/>

![](../../static/img/ligo/schema_fundadvisor.svg)
<small className="figure">FIGURE 1: FundAdvisor</small>

The resulting advice is stored in the storage (in the result field).

### Lambda pattern

The real business logic of the `advisor` smart contract lies in the lambda function, which is defined in the storage. 
The storage can be modified so does the business logic (lambda).

Therefore an entrypoint with `ChangeAlgorithm` is provided to modify the algorithm that computes the worth of the investment.

> **Lambda pattern**   
> Changing the behaviour of a smart contract can be done by customizing its implementation through the lambda functions. The idea is to implement the smart contract logic in a lambda function that can be modified after the contract is deployed. Find out more about lambda [here](https://tezosacademy.io/pascal/chapter-lambda).

## Requirement

1. A LIGO compiler, and a code editor installed. If not, go [there](https://opentezos.com/ligo/installation).
2. A sandboxed mode ready.

## Sandboxed mode

This part will explain to you how to run a 'localhost-only' instance of a Tezos network.

### Run a sandboxed node

For instance, if you want to run a local network with two nodes, in the first terminal, the following command will initialize a node listening for peers on port 19731 and listening for RPC on port 18731.

```shell
./src/bin_node/tezos-sandboxed-node.sh 1 --connections 1
```

To launch the second node, run the following command in another terminal, and it will listen to port 19739 and 18739:

```shell
./src/bin_node/tezos-sandboxed-node.sh 9 --connections 1
```

### Use the sandboxed client

Once your node is running, open a new terminal and initialize the `sandboxed` client data in a temporary directory:

```shell
eval `./src/bin_client/tezos-init-sandboxed-client.sh 1`
```

### Activate a protocol

```shell
tezos-activate-alpha
```

> Find out more about sandboxed mode [here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/user/sandbox.html)

## First contract - Indice

The indice contract represents a fund value.

### Defining storage and entrypoints

Let's create a file `indice_types.ligo` to put all the needed type definitions.

- `indiceStorage` is an integer type that can have the value of an equity.
- `indiceEntrypoints` determines how the contract will be invoked:
  - By increasing the value of the contract storage by using `Increment of int`.
  - By decreasing it with `Decrement of int`.
  - By sending its value to another contract that has called it, using `SendValue of unit`.
- `indiceFullReturn` determines the return type of the main function.

```js
// indice_types.ligo

type indiceStorage is int

type indiceEntrypoints is Increment of int | Decrement of int | SendValue of unit

type indiceFullReturn is list(operation) * indiceStorage
```

> Note that the `sendValue` entrypoint does not take any parameter.

### Defining the main function

Now let's move to the file `indice.ligo` that includes the previous file `indice_types.ligo` and create the main function `indiceMain` with writing `#include "indice_types.ligo"` at the beginning of the script.

```js
// indice.ligo
`#include "indice_types.ligo"`

function indiceMain(const ep : indiceEntrypoints; const store : indiceStorage) : indiceFullReturn is
block { skip } with ((nil: list(operation)), store )
```

Let's keep the block empty for now and see if it compiles correctly.

```shell
ligo compile-contract indice.ligo indiceMain
```

This should return:

```js
{ parameter or (or (int %decrement) (int %increment) (unit %sendValue)) ;
  storage int ;
  code { CDR ; NIL operation ; PAIR } }
```

Now let's implement the three entrypoints:

```js
// indice.ligo
`#include "indice_types.ligo"`

function indiceMain(const ep : indiceEntrypoints; const store : indiceStorage) : indiceFullReturn is
block { 
    const ret : indiceFullReturn = case ep of 
    | Increment(p) -> increment(p, store)
    | Decrement(p) -> decrement(p, store)
    | SendValue(p) -> sendValue(p, store)
    end;
    
 } with ret
```

### Defining the entrypoints

#### Increment

The `increment` function takes two parameters:
- `param` of type `int`, which is the value that will be added to the storage,
- `s` the initial value of the storage.

This function's return type is `indiceFullReturn` and returns:
- an empty list of operations,
- a modified storage with a new value of `s + param`.

```js
//indice.ligo

function increment(const param : int; const s : indiceStorage) : indiceFullReturn is 
block { skip } with ((nil: list(operation)), s + param)
```

#### Decrement

The `decrement` function takes two parameters:
- `param` of type `int`, which is the value that will be removed from the storage,
- `s` the initial value of the storage.

This function's return type is `indiceFullReturn` and returns:
- an empty list of operations,
- a modified storage with a new value of `s - param`.

```js
//indice.ligo

function decrement(const param : int; const s : indiceStorage) : indiceFullReturn is 
block { skip } with ((nil: list(operation)), s - param)
```

#### SendValue

The `sendValue` function takes two parameters:
- `param` of type `unit`, which means it takes no parameter,
- `s` the initial value of the storage.

This function's return type is `indiceFullReturn` and it returns:
- a list of operations containing a transaction,
- the initial storage that is not modified.

The predefined function `Tezos.get_entrypoint_opt` can be used to retrieve the definition of a single entry point.  `%receiveValue` is the label of the entrypoint that will be defined in the advisor contract.

When the function `get_entrypoint_opt` does not find any contract at a given `address`, or if the contract doesn't match the type, then `None` is returned.

> Note that the `Tezos.get_entrypoint_opt` function is a two-way communication solution between contract that are already deployed.
> Find out more on `Tezos.get_entrypoint_opt` [here](https://tezosacademy.io/pascal/chapter-polymorphism).

```js
//indice.ligo

function sendValue(const param : unit; const s : indiceStorage) : indiceFullReturn is 
block { 
    const c_opt : option(contract(int)) = Tezos.get_entrypoint_opt("%receiveValue", Tezos.sender);
    const receiver : contract(int) = case c_opt of
    | Some(c) -> c
    | None -> (failwith("sender cannot receive indice value") : contract(int))
    end;
    const op : operation = Tezos.transaction(s, 0mutez, receiver);
    const txs : list(operation) = list [ op; ];
 } with (txs, s)
```

Let's compile again the main function to be sure we made no mistakes.

```shell
ligo compile-contract indice.ligo indiceMain
```

## Second contract - Advisor

Remember that the `advisor` contract can be invoked to request the value of the fund from the `indice` contract (via a transaction). The `indice` contract receives the request transaction and will send back the requested value. When the `advisor` contract receives the fund value, it can apply the _algorithm_ to check that it is worth investing.

### Defining storage and entrypoints

In a new file called `advisor_types.ligo` we define:
- `advisorStorage` which is a record type containing three fields:
    - `indiceAddress` of type `address` to communicate with the `indice` contract.
    - `algorithm` that takes an `int` as a parameter and returns a `bool`, depending on the business logic.
    - `result` that is `True` if the investor should invest and `False` otherwise.
- `advisorEntrypoints` that determines how the contract will be invoked:
    - By receiving an integer value from another contract's storage with `ReceiveValue of int`.
    - By requesting this value with `sendValue of unit`. 
    - By modifying the algorithm that computes the worth of the investment with `ChangeAlgorithm of advisorAlgo`.
- `advisorFullReturn` that determines the return type of the main function.

```js
//advisor_types.ligo
type advisorAlgo is int -> bool

type advisorStorage is record [
    indiceAddress : address;
    algorithm : advisorAlgo;
    result : bool;
]

type advisorEntrypoints is ReceiveValue of int | RequestValue of unit | ChangeAlgorithm of advisorAlgo

type advisorFullReturn is list(operation) * advisorStorage
```

### Defining the main function

Let's create another file `advisor.ligo` that will include the previous file `advisor_types.ligo` and create the main function `advisorMain`.

```js
//advisor.ligo
#include "advisor_types.ligo"

function advisorMain(const ep : advisorEntrypoints; const store : advisorStorage) : advisorFullReturn is
block { 
    const ret : advisorFullReturn = case ep of 
    | ReceiveValue(p) -> execute(p, store)
    | RequestValue(p) -> request(p, store)
    | ChangeAlgorithm(p) -> change(p, store)
    end;
 } with ret
```

### Defining the entrypoints

#### ReceiveValue

Symmetrically to the `SendValue` function defined for the indice contract, we define the `RequestValue` function, so that the two-way communication can be complete.

The `request` function takes two parameters:
- `param` of type `unit`, which means it takes no parameter.
- `s` the initial value of the storage.

This function's return type is `advisorFullReturn` and returns:
- a list of operations containing a transaction,
- the initial storage that is not modified.

```js
//advisor.ligo

function request(const p : unit; const s : advisorStorage) : advisorFullReturn is
block { 
    const c_opt : option(contract(unit)) = Tezos.get_entrypoint_opt("%sendValue", s.indiceAddress);
    const receiver : contract(unit) = case c_opt of
    | Some(c) -> c
    | None -> (failwith("indice cannot send its value") : contract(unit))
    end;
    const op : operation = Tezos.transaction(unit, 0mutez, receiver);
    const txs : list(operation) = list [ op; ];
 } with (txs, s)
```

#### RequestValue

The `execute` function takes two parameters:
- `indiceVal` of type `int`, which is the value that will be passed in the algorithm,
- `s` the initial value of the storage.

This function's return type is `advisorFullReturn` and returns:
- an empty list of operations,
- a modified storage with a new value for `s.result` that will be the boolean return of the algorithm.

```js
//advisor.ligo

function execute(const indiceVal : int; const s : advisorStorage) : advisorFullReturn is
block { 
    s.result := s.algorithm(indiceVal)
 } with ((nil : list(operation)), s)
```

#### ChangeAlgorithm

`change` function takes two parameters:
- `p` of type `advisorAlgo` which is the algorithm function corresponding to the wanted business logic.
- `s` the initial value of the storage.

This function's return type is `advisorFullReturn` and returns:
- an empty list of operations
- a modified storage with a new value for `s.algorithm`.

```js
//advisor.ligo

function change(const p : advisorAlgo; const s : advisorStorage) : advisorFullReturn is
block { 
    s.algorithm := p;
 } with ((nil : list(operation)), s)
```

Let's compile the main function.

```shell
ligo compile-contract advisor.ligo advisorMain
```

## Dry-run, compilation and deployment

### Indice contract

```js
//indice.ligo
#include "indice_types.ligo"

function increment(const param : int; const s : indiceStorage) : indiceFullReturn is 
block { skip } with ((nil: list(operation)), s + param)

function decrement(const param : int; const s : indiceStorage) : indiceFullReturn is 
block { skip } with ((nil: list(operation)), s - param)

function sendValue(const param : unit; const s : indiceStorage) : indiceFullReturn is 
block { 
    const c_opt : option(contract(int)) = Tezos.get_entrypoint_opt("%receiveValue", Tezos.sender);
    const receiver : contract(int) = case c_opt of
    | Some(c) -> c
    | None -> (failwith("sender cannot receive indice value") : contract(int))
    end;
    const op : operation = Tezos.transaction(s, 0mutez, receiver);
    const txs : list(operation) = list [ op; ];
 } with (txs, s)

function indiceMain(const ep : indiceEntrypoints; const store : indiceStorage) : indiceFullReturn is
block { 
    const ret : indiceFullReturn = case ep of 
    | Increment(p) -> increment(p, store)
    | Decrement(p) -> decrement(p, store)
    | SendValue(p) -> sendValue(p, store)
    end;
    
 } with ret
```

#### Simulation

Let's simulate the indice contract with the increment action using `5` as a parameter and initial storage of `0`.

```shell
ligo dry-run indice.ligo indiceMain 'Increment(5)' '0'
```

This should return:

```js
( LIST_EMPTY(), 5 )
```

As expected, there is an empty list of operations, and the storage has been incremented by 5.

To be sure let's modify the initial value of the storage to `4`.

```shell
ligo dry-run indice.ligo indiceMain 'Increment(5)' '4'
```

This should return:

```js
( LIST_EMPTY(), 9 )
```

Let's simulate another entrypoint, `sendValue`:

```shell
ligo dry-run indice.ligo indiceMain 'SendValue(unit)' '3'
```

This command should return:

```js
failwith("sender cannot receive indice value")
```

This is because the contract is not deployed yet. This is the limit of this simulation.

#### Compilation

Now, let's prepare the parameters and the storage.

```shell
ligo compile-storage indice.ligo indiceMain '0'
#output: 0
```

```shell
ligo compile-parameter indice.ligo indiceMain 'Increment(5)'
#output: (Left (Right 5))
```

```shell
ligo compile-parameter indice.ligo indiceMain 'Decrement(5)'
#output: (Left (Left 5))
```

```shell
ligo compile-parameter indice.ligo indiceMain 'SendValue(unit)'
#output: (Right Unit)
```

> **Reminder:** `0`, `(Left (Right 5))`, `(Left (Left 5))`, `(Right Unit)` are Michelson expressions that can also be used as parameters in `tezos-client` command lines.

We can now compile the main function and save the output in an `indice.tz` file.

```shell
ligo compile-contract indice.ligo indiceMain > indice.tz
```

This should return:

```js
{ parameter (or (or (int %decrement) (int %increment)) (unit %sendValue)) ;
  storage int ;
  code { DUP ;
         CDR ;
         SWAP ;
         CAR ;
         IF_LEFT
           { IF_LEFT
               { SWAP ; SUB ; NIL operation ; PAIR }
               { ADD ; NIL operation ; PAIR } }
           { DROP ;
             SENDER ;
             CONTRACT %receiveValue int ;
             IF_NONE { PUSH string "sender cannot receive indice value" ; FAILWITH } {} ;
             PUSH mutez 0 ;
             DIG 2 ;
             DUP ;
             DUG 3 ;
             TRANSFER_TOKENS ;
             SWAP ;
             NIL operation ;
             DIG 2 ;
             CONS ;
             PAIR } } }
```

#### Deployment

To display the list of deployed contracts, run the following command:

```shell
tezos-client list known contracts
```

This should return something like this:

```
activator: tz1TGu6TN5GSez2ndXXeDX6LgUDvLzPLqgYV
bootstrap5: tz1ddb9NMYHZi5UzPdzTZMYQQZoMub195zgv
bootstrap3: tz1b7tUupMgCNw2cCLpKTkSD1NZzB5TkP2sv
bootstrap2: tz1faswCTDciRzE4oJ9jn2Vm2dvjeyA9fUzU
bootstrap1: tz1KqTpEZ7Yob7QbPE4Hy4Wo8fHG8LhKxZSx
```

Note that in the sandboxed mode, some users automatically created so we can easily use them.

It's time to deploy the indice smart contract.

```shell
tezos-client originate contract indice transferring 1 from bootstrap1  running 'indice.tz' --init '0' --dry-run
```

You may have an error message telling you to specify the gaz fee with `--burn-cap`. If everything works properly, run the same command without the `--dry-run` part.

```shell
tezos-client originate contract indice transferring 1 from bootstrap1  running 'indice.tz' --init '0' --burn-cap 0.12525
```

The transaction is now launched, and you should have the following response:

```
Node is boostrapped.
Estimated gas 2306,275 units (will add 100 + 88 for safety)
Estimated storage: 501 bytes added (will add 20 for safety)
Operation successfully injected in the node.
Operation hash is 'opR766cSqn37L8qCjgcEqu4tfGeukCKBezpHjjicAYB4NYf6g2b'
Waiting for the operation to be included...
```

Let's open another terminal in order to bake this transaction using the following command line:

```shell
tezos-client bake for bootstrap1
```

> **Tezos baking** is the process of signing and appending a block of transactions to the Tezos blockchain.

Now, run the command below and see your indice contract on the list.

```shell
tezos-client list known contracts
```

```
indice: KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn
activator: tz1TGu6TN5GSez2ndXXeDX6LgUDvLzPLqgYV
bootstrap5: tz1ddb9NMYHZi5UzPdzTZMYQQZoMub195zgv
bootstrap3: tz1b7tUupMgCNw2cCLpKTkSD1NZzB5TkP2sv
bootstrap2: tz1faswCTDciRzE4oJ9jn2Vm2dvjeyA9fUzU
bootstrap1: tz1KqTpEZ7Yob7QbPE4Hy4Wo8fHG8LhKxZSx
```

Write down your indice contract address somewhere because you will need it to initialize your advisor contract.

### Advisor contract

```js
//advisor.ligo
#include "advisor_types.ligo"

function request(const p : unit; const s : advisorStorage) : advisorFullReturn is
block { 
    const c_opt : option(contract(unit)) = Tezos.get_entrypoint_opt("%sendValue", s.indiceAddress);
    const receiver : contract(unit) = case c_opt of
    | Some(c) -> c
    | None -> (failwith("indice cannot send its value") : contract(unit))
    end;
    const op : operation = Tezos.transaction(unit, 0mutez, receiver);
    const txs : list(operation) = list [ op; ];
 } with (txs, s)

function execute(const indiceVal : int; const s : advisorStorage) : advisorFullReturn is
block { 
    s.result := s.algorithm(indiceVal)
 } with ((nil : list(operation)), s)


function change(const p : advisorAlgo; const s : advisorStorage) : advisorFullReturn is
block { 
    s.algorithm := p;
 } with ((nil : list(operation)), s)

function advisorMain(const ep : advisorEntrypoints; const store : advisorStorage) : advisorFullReturn is
block { 
    const ret : advisorFullReturn = case ep of 
    | ReceiveValue(p) -> execute(p, store)
    | RequestValue(p) -> request(p, store)
    | ChangeAlgorithm(p) -> change(p, store)
    end;
 } with ret
```

#### Simulation

Let's simulate the advisor contract with an initial storage of:  
`record[indiceAddress=("KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn" : address); algorithm=(function(const i : int) is False); result=False]`.

Note that we choose a simple algorithm function that is `function(const i : int) is False` therefore the saved result is `False` too.

Let's simulate again with `ReceiveValue(5)` as an action.

```shell
ligo dry-run advisor.ligo advisorMain 'ReceiveValue(5)' 'record[indiceAddress=("KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn" : address); algorithm=(function(const i : int) is False); result=False];'
```

Let's simulate with `RequestValue(unit)` as an action.

```shell
ligo dry-run advisor.ligo advisorMain 'RequestValue(unit)' 'record[indiceAddress=("KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn" : address); algorithm=(function(const i : int) is False); result=False]'
```

Let's simulate with `ChangeAlgorithm(function(const i : int) is if i < 10 then True else False)` as action.

```shell
ligo dry-run advisor.ligo advisorMain 'ReceiveValue(5)' 'record[indiceAddress=("KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn" : address); algorithm=(function(const i : int) is False); result=False]'
```

#### Compilation

Now, let's prepare the parameters and the storage.

```shell
ligo compile-parameter advisor.ligo advisorMain 'ReceiveValue(5)'
#output: (Left (Right 5))
```

```shell
ligo compile-parameter advisor.ligo advisorMain 'RequestValue(unit)'
#output: (Right Unit)
```

Let's say we want to change the algorithm to a more interesting one while still using a simple business logic: 
*if the indice of a stock (indice storage) is under 20, one should invest*.

```shell
ligo compile-parameter advisor.ligo advisorMain 'ChangeAlgorithm(function(const i : int) is if i < 20 then True else False)'
#output: (Left (Left { PUSH int 20 ; SWAP ; COMPARE ; LT ; IF { PUSH bool True ] [ PUSH bool False } }))
```

Let's compile the storage with a similar business logic as an initial state.

```shell
ligo compile-storage advisor.ligo advisorMain 'record[indiceAddress=("KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn" : address); algorithm=(function(const i : int) is if i < 10 then True else False); result=False]'
```

This command should return:

```js
(Pair (Pair { PUSH int 10 ;
              SWAP ;
              COMPARE ;
              LT ;
              IF { PUSH bool True ] [ PUSH bool False } }
            "KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn")
      False) 
```

Once everything looks ok, we can compile the main function and save the output in an `advisor.tz` file.

```shell
ligo compile-contract advisor.ligo indiceMain > advisor.tz
```

This should return:

#### Deployment

As we did for the _indice_ contract, let's run the following command in a `--dry-run` mode. In the `--init` section we put the _Michelson_ result of the `compile-storage` that we just ran above.

```shell
tezos-client originate contract advisor transferring 1 from bootstrap1  running 'advisor.tz' --init '(Pair (Pair { PUSH int 10 ; SWAP ; COMPARE ; LT ; IF { PUSH bool True } { PUSH bool False } } "KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn") False)' --dry-run
```

You may have an error message telling you to specify the gaz fee with `--burn-cap`. Try again and if everything works properly, run the same command without the `--dry-run` part.

```shell
tezos-client originate contract advisor transferring 1 from bootstrap1  running 'advisor.tz' --init '(Pair (Pair { PUSH int 10 ; SWAP ; COMPARE ; LT ; IF { PUSH bool True } { PUSH bool False } } "KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn") False)' --burn-cap 0.16825
```

The transaction is now launched, and you should have the following response:

```
Node is boostrapped.
Estimated gas 3144,273 units (will add 100 + 112 for safety)
Estimated storage: 673 bytes added (will add 20 for safety)
Operation successfully injected in the node.
Operation hash is 'opR766cSqn37L8qCjgcEqu4tfGeukCKBezpHjjicAYB4NYf6g2b'
Waiting for the operation to be included...
```

Let's open another initialized terminal in order to bake this transaction using the following command line:

```shell
tezos-client bake for bootstrap1
```

Now, run the command below to see your advisor contract on the list.

```shell
tezos-client list known contracts
```

```
advisor: KT1FzbmriX7zNuKh6wTiRQidk9eyb7zFsk6c
indice: KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn
activator: tz1TGu6TN5GSez2ndXXeDX6LgUDvLzPLqgYV
bootstrap5: tz1ddb9NMYHZi5UzPdzTZMYQQZoMub195zgv
bootstrap3: tz1b7tUupMgCNw2cCLpKTkSD1NZzB5TkP2sv
bootstrap2: tz1faswCTDciRzE4oJ9jn2Vm2dvjeyA9fUzU
bootstrap1: tz1KqTpEZ7Yob7QbPE4Hy4Wo8fHG8LhKxZSx
```

### Use

Now that the two contracts are deployed, we are able to use them. You can run the following command to access the storage of the indicated contract.

```shell
tezos-client get contract storage for advisor
```

This should return the same result as the `compile-storage` command, because no transaction has been made so far.

```js
(Pair (Pair { PUSH int 10 ;
              SWAP ;
              COMPARE ;
              LT ;
              IF { PUSH bool True ] [ PUSH bool False } }
            "KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn")
      False) 
```

Let's check for the _indice_ contract as well.

```shell
tezos-client get contract storage for indice
//output: 0
```

Now, let's make a transaction. Imagine the user **bootstrap3** wants to use the advisor smart contract to know if he should invest. For that, he must make a transaction using the action `RequestValue(Unit)` for which the Michelson expression is `(Right Unit)`.

```shell
tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap3 to advisor --arg '(Right Unit)'
```

Then in another terminal, let's bake for **bootstrap3**,

```shell
tezos-client bake for bootstrap3
```

Now let's check if it is worth investment by looking at the storage.

```shell
tezos-client get contract storage for advisor
```

```js
(Pair (Pair { PUSH int 10 ;
              SWAP ;
              COMPARE ;
              LT ;
              IF { PUSH bool True ] [ PUSH bool False } }
            "KT1D99kSAsGuLNmT1CAZWx51vgvJpzSQuoZn")
      True) 
```

The result changes from `False` to `True` in the result field if it is worth investing. This is the case here because the initial value of the indice storage is still `0` and our algorithm will returns _True_ if this value is under `10`.

Now, it is your turn to play with these two smart contracts by incrementing the indice storage or changing the advisor algorithm.

> Remember: if you are not sure what you are doing, add `--dry-run` at the end of the command line to see if everything is ok.
