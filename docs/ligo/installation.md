There are currently four ways to get started with LIGO. You can choose to use a Docker image, a static Linux binary, install packages for your Debian Linux distribution, or you can try directly on the [online editor](https://ide.ligolang.org/).

## Dockerized installation (recommended)
If you've [installed üê≥ Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), you are able to run the latest LIGO release 0.21.0:

Linux or OSX:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":"$PWD" -w "$PWD" ligolang/ligo:0.21.0
```

Note that this command is equivalent to running _ligo_ itself, so you might want to create an alias for it:
```
alias ligo='docker run --rm -v "$PWD":"$PWD" -w "$PWD" ligolang/ligo:0.21.0'
``` 

Windows:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "%CD%":/cd -w /cd ligolang/ligo:0.21.0
```

Or if you want the development version, replace the version above with `next`.

Or run one of the older versions found at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ligolang/ligo/tags).

## Static Linux binary

The `ligo` executable is statically linked. It should run on most modern Linux distributions.

To use it, get it [here](https://ligolang.org/bin/linux/ligo), make it executable, and you're done!

```zsh
wget https://ligolang.org/bin/linux/ligo
chmod +x ./ligo
```

Optionally, you can put it somewhere in your `PATH` for easy access:

```zsh
sudo cp ./ligo /usr/local/bin
```

## Debian Linux package installation

A `.deb` package containing the static `ligo` executable is also available.
You can download [this package](https://ligolang.org/deb/ligo.deb) or go [here](https://gitlab.com/ligolang/ligo/-/releases), and then install it using:

```zsh
sudo apt install ./ligo.deb
```

## Online Editor

The online editor is the quickest and easiest way to get started.

You can choose your preferred syntax and write your LIGO instructions directly in the text editor. It is available at [ligolang.org](https://ligolang.org/) in the [Try Online](https://ide.ligolang.org/) tab.

You can then execute your code by choosing from the following features:
- Compile
- Compile Function
- Deploy
- Dry Run
- Evaluate Function
- Evaluate Value
- Generate Deploy Script

# Editor Support
Painters need a brush and a canvas. Developers need a good IDE experience. LIGO currently offers support for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), including syntax highlighting and on-the-fly compilation error reporting.

Available extensions:
- **[Syntax highlighting for PascaLigo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LigoLang.pascaligo-vscode)**
- **[On-the-fly compilation error reporting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ligo.ligo-tools)**
