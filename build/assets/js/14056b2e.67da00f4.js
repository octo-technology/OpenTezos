At this point, not only are you not able to withdraw your $1,000 if the bank doesn't have enough reserves from other depositors, but they risk losing your money altogether if its investments fail or the bank goes bankrupt. If a bank has a net deposit of a billion dollars, it only needs to keep around 100 million on hand at any given time.
